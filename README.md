In the domain of steel surface defect detection, conventional object detection algorithms are often characterized by high complexity and substantial computational demands, posing challenges for their deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address this issue, we propose TinyDefectNet, a lightweight detection model based on the YOLOv8n framework. TinyDefectNet employs StarNet as its backbone feature extraction network, leveraging efficient parameter sharing and feature extraction mechanisms to reduce model complexity. Additionally, we introduce the E-C2f module, which integrates EnhanceConv into the C2f module, improved representation of details and edges in feature maps. Furthermore, we design a Lightweight Shared Convolutional Detection Head (LSCD) to minimize parameter count by sharing weight parameters. Extensive experiments on the augmented NEU-DET dataset demonstrate that TinyDefectNet achieves only 1.4M parameters and 4.6 GFLOPs of computational load, representing reductions of 43.7% and 52.9% compared to the baseline model, respectively. When employing the Focal_EIoU loss function, TinyDefectNet achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 83.3% at 265 frames per second (FPS). Here we show that TinyDefectNet outperforms advanced object detection algorithms, requiring fewer computational resources while ensuring high detection accuracy. To validate its generalization ability, experiments are conducted on the APSPC, VOC2012, and GC10-DET datasets, with TinyDefectNet surpassing the baseline model on all datasets. Finally, a real-time steel surface defect detection system based on the Jetson Orin NX platform achieves 58 FPS, confirming TinyDefectNet's suitability for production lines.
The code for TinyDefectNet is included in the compressed file（upgrade）. Please download it and set up the YOLOv8 environment to run the code.
Public datasets such as NEU-DET, APSPC, VOC2012, and GC10-DET can be downloaded independently. Thank you.
